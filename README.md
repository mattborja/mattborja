### Hi there! üëã 

I'm **Matt**. And I'd like to share with you a few highlights about myself that I believe might help to summarize the widely diverse skill set my background entails.

The first time I heard someone use the term "autodidact" in reference to myself was as I sat across the table from a veteran software engineer who sought me out in response to a lecture I did on ‚ÄúApplied Principles in Software Engineering.‚Äù I later learned what that fully meant during the next 4-hours of our conversation.

Growing up in times of uncertainty and volatility, the complex fields of Information Technology has taught me the great importance of aptitude and adaptability: both of which are nearest and dearest to me when faced with new responsibilities, obscure problems, and challenges of the unknown. However, in my perseverance, I sometimes struggle with letting things just merely be ‚Äúgood enough,‚Äù when I have reason to believe it can be made better.

I've also become more acutely aware of the indismissible need for unity in team work: by the rewarding experience of camaraderie and productivity when partners share the same vision, working toward a common goal; and by the suffocating anxiety bred by undefined (else, neglected) industry procedures, lack of leadership, and the incessant competing between members of the same team.

Some will say that there is more to life than work, but reality contends that work itself makes up a very large part of our lives. And so, above and beyond the basic purpose of fulfilling my financial obligations and debt to society, I seek a healthy work environment: one in which I can thrive; where employees are duly recognized and treated with respect; where a culture of excellence and authenticity is actively cultivated; and where passion is met with opportunity, ownership, and support.

With best regards,

Matt Borja
