## Quick Look

### Web Development & Security

★ ★ ★ ★ ★

Full-stack enterprise web application development.

Security-conscious applications built on the formiddable ASP.NET MVC (C#) framework; database-backed by both relational database management engines (i.e. Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle) and document-oriented database engines (i.e. Couchbase, Mongo) with UI/UX investments in HTML 5, Bootstrap, and jQuery.

I also really love Ruby on Rails and Node.js (and the idea of Go), but just haven't had the opportunity to deploy as much with those.

### Operations & Infrastructure

★ ★ ★ ★ ☆

Manual and automated system configuration of highly available application environments.

Load balanced environments configured manually and by convention (using fully loaded Puppet Enterprise) largely include operating systems built on (else derived from) enterprise operating systems including, but not limtied to: Red Hat, CentOS, Windows Server, and Server Core.

### Project & Release Management

★ ★ ★ ★ ☆

Balancing security standards with business requirements: an advocate for well-defined processes and relevant industry standards to achieve scale with consistency.

Experiential investments largely focused on holistically integrating and applying the features of Azure DevOps including but not limited to Repos, Boards, and Pipelines.

### Communications

★ ★ ★ ★ ★

Balancing impetus with stakeholder expectations (and a little bit of stress-relieving humor): an advocate for excellence and the pursuit thereof.
